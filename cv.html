            <p>I'm a software developer specialised in web development with <strong>Ruby</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I'm also very interested in AI, <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and Data Science.</p>

            <p>I value simple solutions over cleverness. I strongly believe that most often
              the biggest bottleneck in software development is our brains and their capacity to
              understand code written by others or by us some time ago. That's why I always
              strive to make things as simple as possible.

          <div class="role">
            <h4>Freelance web developer
              <small class="text-muted">January 2017-Present</small>
            </h4>

            <p>I continued working with my previous employer for a while as freelancer. I've
              spent a fair amount of time learning Machine Learning and Data Science.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="role">
            <h4><a href="freeagent.com">FreeAgent.com</a>
              <small class="text-muted">September 2013-December 2016</small>
            </h4>

            <p>I started working for FreeAgent as a freelancer in March 2013 remotely from
            Spain. In September 2013 I joined the team as a permanent employee. My job title was Senior Software Engineer until April 2016 when it was changed to Software Architect. During all that time I reported directly to the CTO and led the
            Application Infrastructure team from January 2015 until January 2016.
            </p>

            <p>Technically, the job involved extending and maintaining a very large Rails
              app (300K+ lines of Ruby code). I spent a fair amount of time refactoring
              complicated parts of the application and also had my fair share of front end
              development.
            </p>

            <ul class="achivements">
              <li>Implemented the new Time Tracking section of the application.</li>

              <li>Migrated the application to use the Rails Asset Pipeline, <strong>decreasing
                end user page load time by more than 40%.</strong>.
              </li>

              <li>Migrated the app to use strong parameters to prevent mass assignments attacks.</li>

              <li>In 2014 I designed and developed the first version of the FreeAgent mobile
              app. The app was a <strong>hybrid app using React</strong> and Backbone, which allowed us to release almost simultaneous versions for iOS and Android. The app hasn't been rewritten from scratch to this day and instead it has organically evolved over time.
              </li>

              <li>Refactored the test suite. After successive improvements we decreased the run time in the CI server from 30 to 4 minutes.</li>

              <li>Upgraded the main application from Rails 3.2 to Rails 4.2. To achieve this, we chose to follow a very gradual path deploying small changes that ended up
              involving 200+ pull requests.</li>

              <li>Prototyped a Machine Learning system to improve a core flow of the application with a feature yet to be released.</li>

              <li>Refactored the authentication and the session management code.</li>

              support to Reel, I ended up implementing an open source <a href="https://github.com/afcapel/websocket_parser">websocket protocol parser.</a></li>
